            <h2>Visual Identity, Resturant</h2>

            <p>The logotype for Nyrén embodies the restaurant’s rustic and refined aesthetic. The design
                features a bold
                sans-serif “N” as the foundation, with “yrén” in smaller letters beside it for a balanced yet modern
                touch. A striking illustration of a pair of antlers extends to the right of the “N,” arching over
                “yrén,” reinforcing the brand’s connection to nature and rugged elegance.
            </p>
            <p>
                A smaller version of the logotype has been designed for more compact branding needs. In this variation,
                all the letters are roughly the same size, creating a more balanced and streamlined look. The antlers
                are separated and placed below, framing the beginning and end of the name like a delicate wreath. This
                version maintains the rustic charm while offering a more versatile application for menus, packaging, and
                merchandise.

                This visual identity complements the restaurant’s interior, which blends wood, exposed brick,
                black-painted metal, and Western-inspired details. The use of warm, earthy tones and natural textures
                across branding materials will ensure a strong, recognizable presence across signage, menus, and digital
                platforms.
