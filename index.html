                <p>Hi, I’m Wilma, a 19-year-old student of New Media Design at Jönköping
                    University in Sweden.
                    My program offers a dynamic mix of theoretical and practical learning, covering areas like graphic
                    design, UX design,
                    and programming.
                </p>
                <p> I have a deep passion for graphic design and all things art and visual creativity.
                    Recently in my courses, I’ve started building an exciting new skill: programming! Although it’s
                    challenging, I
                    find it both fun and rewarding. </p>
                <p>
                    My favorite creative outlet is working in Adobe Illustrator, especially designing logos. Outside of
                    school, I enjoy painting with watercolors—it’s my way of blending relaxation with artistic
                    expression.
                </p>
