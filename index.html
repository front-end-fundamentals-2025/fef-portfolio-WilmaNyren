        <p class="intro">Hi, I’m Wilma, a 19-year-old student of New Media Design at Jönköping University in Sweden. My
            program offers
            a dynamic mix of theoretical and practical learning, covering areas like graphic design, UX design, and
            programming. </p>
        <p class="intro"> I have a deep passion for graphic design and all things art and visual creativity. Recently in
            my courses, I’ve started building an exciting new skill: programming! Although it’s challenging, I find it
            both fun and rewarding. </p>
        <p class="intro">
            My favorite creative outlet is working in Adobe Illustrator, especially designing logos. Outside of school,
            I enjoy painting with watercolors—it’s my way of blending relaxation with artistic expression.
