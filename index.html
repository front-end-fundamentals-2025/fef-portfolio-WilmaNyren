                <p class="intro">Hi, I’m Wilma, a 19-year-old student of New Media Design at Jönköping
                    University in
                    Sweden.
                    My
                    program offers
                    a dynamic mix of theoretical and practical learning, covering areas like graphic design, UX design,
                    and
                    programming. </p>
                <p class="intro"> I have a deep passion for graphic design and all things art and visual creativity.
                    Recently in
                    my courses, I’ve started building an exciting new skill: programming! Although it’s challenging, I
                    find
                    it
                    both fun and rewarding. </p>
                <p class="intro">
                    My favorite creative outlet is working in Adobe Illustrator, especially designing logos. Outside of
                    school,
                    I enjoy painting with watercolors—it’s my way of blending relaxation with artistic expression.
